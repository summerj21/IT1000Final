## Summer's Example Code

IT 1000 taught Summer how to code in various languages including Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript, Python, and Markdown. The class created various projects to use this code such as Python Turtle Graphics, Fizz Buzz, and Object Position Calculation. 

Here is some code Summer created for projects in IT 1000.

### Object Position Calculation Code

''' initial_position = float(input("Enter the object's initial position: "))
initial_velocity = float(input("Enter the object's initial velocity: "))
time_elapsed = float(input("Enter the object's time elapsed: "))
acceleration = float(input("Enter the object's acceleration: "))
final_position = initial_position + initial_velocity * time_elapsed + 0.5 * acceleration * time_elapsed * time_elapsed
print("The final position is", final_position)'''

### Python Turtle Graphic Code
''' >>> import turtle
>>> 
>>> 
>>> my_turtle = turtle.Turtle()
>>> my_turtle.forward(100)
>>> my_turtle = turtle.Turtle()
>>> my_turtle.forward(200)
>>> my_turtle.left(90)
>>> my_turtle.forward(300)
>>> my_turtle.left(90)
>>> my_turtle.forward(200)
>>> my_turtle.left(90)
>>> my_turtle.forward(300)
>>> '''
